This project was a practice mini-project for participating in a school activity, involving both frontend and backend development. The UI design was done by a classmate, which I slightly modified. One page's layout was entirely copied from the Samsung official website. The frontend utilized Bootstrap for responsive layout and was rendered using Ajax + jQuery. The backend consisted solely of Servlets, with some simple utility functions implemented for file uploading, JavaBean automatic encapsulation, and automatic URL dispatching using reflection. However, I regret to admit that due to my lack of experience, as the project grew, it quickly became a disaster. All the messy code was written by me...
